Managing State:
difficult with many components
Vuex = state management pattern + library

state = the data our components rely on and render
i.e. blog posts,to-do items, etc.
as your app grows, each vue component has its own version of State
but if one component changes its State
and a distant relative is using that state,
we need to communicate that changes
default: events up, props down to share data, can becoem complex

solve: consolidate state in one place that contains current state of our entire application
every Vue component has direct access to this global state
reactive, once one component using that state updates, all other instances update
but...what happens when many dif components alter the state in many ways from many locations?
need standardization:
Vuex provides state mgmt pattern - store

just like we create a new Vue instance:
const app = new Vue({
  data: {

  },
  //methods can update data
  methods: {

  },
  //computed properties can access our data
  computed: {

  }
})
we can create a new Vuex store:
const store = new Vuex.Store({
  state: {

  },
  ***
  //actions can update the Vuex state
  actions: {

  },
  //getters can access our state
  getters: {

  }
})
*** here, store also has mutations, used to commit + track state changes
*** best practice:
actions call mutations
mutations update state directly
*** using Vue devtools allows us to debug by reversing state to previous value
